BECOMING TEXAS

Our understanding of Texas history is always changing. The story of Texas begins long before it was named and drawn on maps.

Objects and stories from our past help us understand where we come from and who we are. New discoveries by archaeologists and historians continually add to what we know.

Discovered in central Texas, this stone point with a broken tip was made at least 14,000 years ago.

For many years scientists believed that the first Americans came from Asia 13,000 years ago.  This discovery suggests that humans came to the Americas much earlier.

An Ancient History

What we now call Texas was home to many different peoples for thousands of years.

More than 3000 years ago farmers settled where the Río Grande and Río Conchos join. More than 1000 years ago the Caddo people built a village 26 miles west of present-day Nacogdoches.

The First Peoples

Hundreds of cultures lived in America before Europeans arrived. They spoke many different languages.  Some were farmers, some were hunters. Some lived in large cities and towns. They traded with each other all across the land.

This finely crafted turquoise armband is over a thousand years old. It was likely placed as a gift in the cave where it was found. For at least a thousand years, people came to the cave in the Hueco Mountains near present day El Paso. They believed "Ceremonial Cave" was a doorway to a watery underworld where all life began.

European Ambitions

For American Indians, the land was already their home for thousands of years. For Europeans, it was a new world.

Two years after Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Bahamas in 1492, Spain claimed the Americas. News that the lands were rich with gold, and silver encouraged Spain to send explorers and soldiers called "conquistadors." Other Europeans soon followed.

A French Explorer's Last Voyage

4.0_tl01

In 1682 French explorer Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle led an expedition from Canada down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed the lands for France and named them, "Louisiana", in honor of King Louis the XIV.

4.0_tl02

In 1684, with the King’s support, La Salle sailed from France with four hundred people and four ships, L'Aimable, La Joly, Le St. Francois, and La Joly, to build a colony at the mouth of the Mississippi.

4.0_tl03

On the way, the ship, Le St. Francois was stolen by Spanish privateers.  The remaining  three ships missed their destination and landed on the present day Texas coast.

4.0_tl04

L'Aimable sank entering Matagorda Bay. La Joly sailed back to France with 120 colonists abandoning the journey. In 1686 the last ship, La Joly, sank in a storm.

The colony was a failure and led to La Salle's death, but the arrival of the French encouraged the Spanish to colonize the lands we now call Texas."

Recovered in 1996 from La Joly, this thin, fragile, gold Sun King medallion was a symbol of King Louis XIV of France.  King Louis provided a large amount of weapons and ammunition for the expedition. To mark them as royal property, weapons supplied by the King were decorated with his emblem.

When archaeologists in 1995 found a French cannon with dolphin shaped handles off the Texas coast, they knew they had found La Joly. This is one of three almost identical cannons found in the wreck.

The "L" with the crown is the monogram of King Louis XIV.  The name of "Comte De Vermandois" with the two crossed anchors is for the King's son, who at age 2 was made Admiral of the Navy by his father."

Small Ship, Dangerous Journey

La Joly was a small ship designed to navigate coastlines and rivers, not oceans. It was built to be brought over in pieces in the hold of a bigger ship and put together when the expedition reached its destination. When La Salle realized they needed more room for all the cargo, they assembled the ship in France. Despite its size, it completed the perilous journey.


4.1_tt01

If you look carefully you will see carvings along the keel (the bottom timber) of the ship. Carved by the boat builders, the marks were a Roman numeral code indicating which pieces came together to construct the ship.

4.2_st02

Navigating the Gulf

A voyage's success depended on a captain's skills, accurate maps, and navigational instruments. Without a good map, La Salle missed his destination at the mouth of the Mississippi.

La Salle's captains had no trouble finding the Gulf of Mexico, but they landed in Louisiana and thought they were in Florida. They continued west till they reached Matagorda Bay on the Texas Coast.

4.2_la01

Three incomplete sandglasses were recovered from the La Joly wreck.

Measuring the distance from east to west, longitude, requires knowing the ship's speed. To measure the speed, a wood board tied to a line was dropped over the side and towed next to the ship. With evenly spaced knots tied in the line, a sailor would count the knots that passed through his fingers over the time measured by a sandglass.

The system was not precise, and a navigator could be miles off course. It was not until 1761 that an accurate clock was made for ships.

Maps were top secret and not shared with enemy nations. To draw this map, French map maker Nicolas De Fer looked at maps from several expeditions.

La Salle and his sailors were able to calculate latitude (distance from the equator) using an astrolabe or a cross staff. A cross staff measures the angle between the horizon and a star or the sun. An astrolabe was used to measure the altitude (height) of the sun or star.

Communication between ships at sea was accomplished by sending messengers back and forth in small boats. Simple instructions would be signaled with whistles like this one found in the wreck. Their high notes could be heard over ocean and weather noises, and in foggy conditions.

4.2_st02

When La Salle ordered the ships to enter Matagorda Bay, the sailors measured the depth of the pass and placed buoys where it was deep enough for La Joly and the ship L'Aimable to enter. La Joly entered without a problem. The captain of L'Aimable ignored the buoys and the ship hit a sandbar and sank. The crews recovered what they could.

As ships got close to the coastline, sailors lowered lead weights smeared with tallow (grease made from animal fat) into the water until the weight touched the ocean bottom. Sailors then measured the wet length of rope to see how deep the water was. The sand or mud stuck to the tallow would tell the sailors what the ocean floor was, and how good it was to hold the anchors.

Packed for a Colony

After the ship L'Aimable sank, the captain of the third ship, Le Joly sailed back to France with 120 discouraged colonists. Left with only the small La Joly, the remaining colonists built a temporary settlement. La Salle ordered the majority of the colony supplies loaded onto La Joly and 27 men to stay on the ship.  La Salle set off on foot in the fall to find the river.

Much of the cargo consisted of goods for trade with Native Americans. La Salle also carried bells, knives, axe heads, pins, finger rings, and non-metal items such as mirrors, combs, and vermillion- a red dye. He traded these for food, horses, and guides, as well as furs and hides that he intended to bring back to France.

4.3_la02

Two barrels containing a total of 675 axe heads were found in La Joly.

4.3_la03

A small collection of combs were found in different areas of the ship. Twelve of the combs were most likely intended for trade, and the others were for personal use. Combs had finely spaced teeth to remove head lice.

More than 500 knives were found in the shipwreck. There were straight knives wrapped in paper, and folding clasped knives to trade.

More than 17,000 brass wire pins were found in the hold of the ship.

4.3_la07

American Indians valued vermillion, a bright red cinnabar pigment, to paint their bodies for sacred rituals.

4.3_la08

While exploring Canada, La Salle learned that glass beads held value within American Indian trade networks, so he brought slightly more than 785,000 glass beads. Strung by color, there were 25 different types of beads found.

4.3_la09

Europeans used hawk bells with hunting birds. Attached to a hawk’s legs the bells helped locate the hawk in the field. American Indians sewed the bells on to clothing. More than 1600 bells were found in La Joly.

Found on the ship were one thousand six hundred and three rings with Roman Catholic religious symbols and images on them.

4.3_la11

Remnants of about 46 of the 400 flintlock firearms brought by the expedition were recovered in the wreck.

A well-trained soldier could load and fire a musket two times a minute. It took longer to load a musket as it became dirty it became harder to ram the ball and powder.

4.3_la12

There were seven different types of pole arms found in La Joly. With their sharp blades at the end of a long pole, pole arms were popular European weapons used for close combat.

With the rise of guns in the early 1700s pole arms were used less.

Lost Supplies, Lost Lives

Searching for the Mississippi on foot, La Salle’s return to the colony was delayed by months. La Joly sat in the bay with 27 people on board. They grew hungry, thirsty, and desperate. People began dying. A powerful storm blew in and they lost control of the ship. La Joly slammed aground and sank. Their only means to return to France and most of their supplies were lost.

4.4_la02

Twenty-seven people were on the ship when it sank in a storm on Matagorda Bay in 1686. Only six survived. The remains of two individuals were recovered in La Joly.

The colonists struggled to survive at their temporary settlement. The French had started a war with Karankawa Indians by stealing two of their canoes. The French fort provided little protection from the weather or from Karankawa. By 1687, there were only 37 colonists left. In a final attempt to get help for the colony, La Salle took seventeen men to hike north to reach Canada and get help. On the way some of his men mutinied and killed him.

4.5_la01

A friend of La Salle's family named Henri Joutel was on the expedition. Joutel kept a daily journal. After La Salle was murdered, Joutel continued with a handful of survivors to Canada and returned to France in 1688. His journal became an important resource for future French expeditions to North America.

Joutel's journal was first published in an abbreviated French version in 1713. This English version was printed in 1715.

Looking for La Salle, the Spanish found his fort destroyed in 1689. Most of the colonists had died from disease or were killed by Karankawa.  Later, some of the French children were found living as Karankawa and they were brought back to Mexico City.

La Salle's colony failed, but the expedition motivated Spanish interest in settling the region.

When La Joly was excavated in 1996, archaeologists discovered two human skeletons. One skeleton was found lying on a large coil of rope. An exact replica of the skull was made using 3d printing technology. The bones and other artifacts found nearby provide clues as to the skeleton's identity.

Scientists learned the bones were of a man about 5'5"" tall, in his late 30's or early 40's. He had lower back problems that would have caused him to walk with a painful limp. A small cup was found with him and he may have died of dehydration before the ship sank. The sailors' remains were buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

Over the hundreds of years since the ship sank, hard layers called "concretions" formed around the iron objects.

Using the concretions as molds, the archaeologists were able to make casts of the objects.

Spanish Dominion in Name Only

The Spanish wanted to keep the French from settling lands Spain had claimed for more than two hundred years. The Spanish expanded their colony from Mexico by building missions, presidios (military forts), and towns along routes and rivers. The Spanish quickly learned diverse American Indian tribes controlled the lands, not Spain.

5.1_st01

New Spain Expands North

The missions and presidios were far from the Spanish rulers in Mexico City. The lands were controlled by many different tribes. To survive, the Spanish had to adjust to their new environment and form alliances with the tribes.

5.1_tt01

Missions were settlements where priests called missionaries worked to convert people to Catholicism. The Spanish believed that American Indians would join missions, become Catholics and accept the Spanish way of life.  Mission life was strictly scheduled between bible studies and work. Many American Indians liked their own way of life more than mission life; they only came to stay for short periods of time when they needed protection from enemy tribes.

This "santo" of Saint Francis from the late 1700's to early 1800's was found in a San Antonio mission. Saint Francis was an Italian Catholic preacher who started his Franciscan order in 1209. Arriving in Mexico in 1523, Franciscans were the first missionaries in New Spain. Franciscan friars wore robes made of coarse fabric, with a belt made of rope that had three knots. The knots symbolize their vows of obedience, poverty and chastity.

"Santos" are Roman Catholic paintings and sculptures of specific saints. The santo tradition was brought to the Americas by the Spanish in the early 1500s.

The Settlers of New Spain

Diverse groups of colonists lived in New Spain. The Spaniards who arrived directly from Spain were called,"peninsulares".  "Criollos" were Spaniards born in Mexico. There were also Africans and Canary Islanders. People of mixed ethnicity were called "castas".

Before 1821 the number of Spanish settlers in the Texas settlements was never more than about 3,000, while Mexico City had over 160,000 residents.

San Antonio was founded in 1718 with families from Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, Mexico. A year later the governor of Coahuila and Texas asked that 400 families from the Canary Islands, Spain, or Cuba be moved to San Antonio.

The word “ranch” comes from the Mexican-Spanish “rancho”. Ranching in Texas began with the missions, presidios, and among the early soldier-settlers. Life on early ranchos was hard; the settlers had to make a new life on the frontier under constant threat of attack by enemy Indian tribes.

Soldiers Beyond the Frontier

Life in the presidios was hard and dangerous. Some soldiers were from Spain, but most were born in New Spain. The enlistment period was often ten years. The government encouraged soldiers to bring their families or marry Indian woman who lived in the missions. Soldiers joined Presidios in part for the possibility of owning land, and to gain status. The soldiers earned about $10,000 a year in today’s value. They were often not paid for long periods of time. Commanders, who earned close to $150,000 a year, controlled the price of clothes and supplies, often making them too expensive, causing soldiers to go into debt.

Diverse Cultures

Numerous tribal groups controlled the lands where the Spanish settled. Each had its own language and culture. Some were migratory, others lived in large farming communities and villages. Trade between tribes allowed them to benefit from each other. Trade routes throughout the Americas existed long before Europeans arrived. Changing relationships with other tribes,  forces of nature, and other major events changed the balance of power through the years.

6.1_avt01

Clothes, weapons, tools, and toys, were made by American Indians using natural materials from the animals and land around them. What they could not find, they would acquire from others.  Each tribe had its own style in clothing, hair, jewelry, tattoos, and decorations.

Natural pigments were used to paint bodies, clothing, dwellings, and rock walls. The use of pigments was not purely decorative, the colors symbolized different things, and some paintings depicted specific stories and memories of individuals and tribes.

Glass trade beads were one of the earliest items that the Europeans traded with the American Indians. Spaniards were already trading beads in New Mexico by the middle 1500s. Trade beads spread throughout the trade routes. Colors held different symbolic meanings for different tribes, and certain color beads were more popular than others.

Porcupine quills were colored and used to make headdresses called "roaches".  They were also  flattened and colored with different color pigments to decorate clothing and bags. The quills were stitched into the hides using sinew thread.

(Script Code?)

Depending on how they were going to be used, the hides were then prepared in different ways. Some were prepared soft so they could be worn, some with their furs still on to make them warm. Others were prepared to be thick and hard to be used for more protective uses, like for the soles of moccasins.

Moccasins were usually made from the soft tanned hides of deer or bison. Harder rawhide was used for the soles for better foot protection. Thick hides were very hard to sew but they made longer lasting moccasins.

The Jumano were called by many names, and lived just north of Big Bend and in south-eastern New Mexico. They lived in pueblo communities, multi-storied buildings made from large mud bricks, but were known for traveling long-distances. Their mastery of trade routes and languages made them important negotiators between tribes and European settlers. In addition to salt, pigments, and bison, Jumanos were important horse traders and raised large herds.

Today some families in Texas identify as Apache-Jumano.

The Tickanwa-tic, (Tonkawa) meaning “real people” were migratory tribes in what is now Central Texas, Western Oklahoma, and Eastern New Mexico. The Apache forced the Tonkawa to move their vast hunting grounds and trading centers to territory near present day Austin. Caddo, Jumano, and Coahuiltecan peoples camped and traded with them during the summer months. The Tonkawa were allied at different times with Comanche, Wichita and Lipan Apache.

The Tonkawa Tribal Reserve is located today in Kay County, Northern Oklahoma.

Searching for better hunting and farming lands, the Ndeh (Lipan Apache) migrated south in the 1600s. They ruled the upper Colorado and Concho Rivers westward to the Pecos River. For trade goods, Lipan Apache hunted and took horses from Spanish settlements and Caddo, Wichita, and Jumano herds. In the mid-1700s, Comanche pushed Lipan Apaches far into northern Mexico and present day Texas’s southern coast.

Today the Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas headquarters in McAllen.

The Nʉmʉnʉʉ, (Comanche) or “The People,” were a migratory group skilled at hunting and superior horsemanship. They expanded from the northern Plains into western Oklahoma and Texas by the early 1700s, eventually ruling a 240,000-square-mile territory. Comanche hosted large summer and fall trade fairs. In exchange for horses, mules, bison robes and hides, Comanche received weapons, kettles, textiles, and food.

A confederation of several groups, the Wichita called themselves Kitikiti'sh, meaning “raccoon eyes,” because of their facial tattoos. Near communities of large grass-structured homes they grew crops, hunted, and fished. In the early 1700s,  Wichita moved from northern territories into north-eastern Tejas. Allied with the Comanche by the 1750s, they became important trade negotiators with the French.

Headquartered in Caddo County, Oklahoma, the Wichita tribes are the Waco, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Wichita, and Kichai.

The people called Coahuiltecans by anthropologists were actually many very diverse bands of American Indians.  Living in groups of 100-300 people, they hunted and gathered seasonally along the Rio Grande region of the present day South Texas Plains. They traveled long distances to trade with Caddo and Jumano at fair camps near modern day San Marcos, Austin, La Grange and Victoria.

Today, some people still trace their roots to these early inhabitants of Tejas.

The Karankawa, five groups with a common language — the Cocos, Carancaguases, Cujanes, Coapites, and Copanes — lived between Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi. Migrating seasonally along the coast they hunted bison, deer, antelope, and bear, alligators, turtles, birds, and fish. With the Caddo and Tonkawa they traded mescal beans and shells for pigments, flint, bison hides and sinew.

Historians believe the Karankawa were decimated by colonists in the 1850s. Their lineage lives on in other tribes.

The early Kadohadacho (Caddos) lived in farming societies for generations in the eastern woodlands of present day Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Using wood and grasses, they built domed shaped homes along primary trade routes. Caddo traded pottery, bows, and salt gathered from local springs for seashells from Florida, copper from the Great Lakes, marble from Appalachia, and flint from the Ozarks.

Today the Caddo live throughout the U.S. with their tribal government in Oklahoma.

Comanche warriors carried two shields, one for protection in battle, and the other for spiritual protection.

Shield making was one of the most important ceremonies for a warrior. Young warriors would go on vision quests, which included going away from the village and fasting for several days. During this time, a “spiritual protector” would reveal itself to the young man. The warrior would then paint on his design, and attach animal hides, feathers, and other things to provide the warrior with those animals’ abilities.

The name “Texas” is a reminder that, before European arrival, its lands were ruled by American Indians. Spanish names of towns, cities, rivers, and lands, are reminders that Texas was claimed by Spain for more than 300 years. Descendants of American Indians, Canary Islanders, Africans, Spaniards, Mexicans, and French, are proud of their heritage. Their roots are part of the rich story of Texas.
